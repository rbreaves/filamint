# Filamint

A modern and simple XFCE4 theme based on Numix, Qogir, and borders by Richard Wurth. Best applied to Qogir-Dark theme directory.

I plan to expand this theme and create a few more variations. Already the accent colors can be changed by simply changing the style under Appearance.

All authors appear to use GPL-3.0 so I believe the merging of inspiration and components is within the license. Modifications were of course made by me to make this work as needed.
